# Asteroid Escape Solver

C# code that finds the shortest path to to solve any level from the Asteroid Escape puzzle game. Quick and dirty project not made with readability or performance in mind (solves any puzzle in blink of an eye though). Uses BFS to find shortest paths to each reachable arrangement afterwhich iterates those to find the shortest path to the finish. Prints the moves required for the shortest path as well as animates the solution as shown below:
